# frontend-bootcamp-week-01

First week of the edX frontend bootcamp

## Day 01

### All files in 'first_day_stuff' folder

- Used 'touch' to create files
- Made our first HTML webpage
- Added a second with more things in it including lists, tables and an embedded YouTube video, which wouldn't work.

Also organised files and created this Git repo on GitHub
